### *Empowering Communities, Healing Ecosystems*

## 💡 **Introduction**

### **Problem Statement**
Blue carbon ecosystem restoration in India lacks a decentralized, transparent system for **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)** of projects.  
Current methods face issues like **data tampering, manual validation delays**, and **limited participation** of NGOs and local panchayats, making carbon credit generation unreliable and inefficient.

### **Solution**
**CarbonChain** is a **Blockchain-powered Blue Carbon Registry and MRV system** that ensures **transparency, trust, and accountability** in coastal restoration.  
Through a **Flutter-based mobile DApp**, NGOs and communities can upload **geo-tagged field data, photos, and project details**, which are stored immutably on the blockchain.  

AI-assisted validation cross-checks data using **drone/satellite imagery** and baseline datasets, while **NCCR administrators** review and approve projects.  
Once approved, **smart contracts tokenize verified carbon credits** into community digital wallets. A **transparent marketplace** then enables **corporates and investors** to purchase verified offsets, directly supporting local restoration efforts.  

CarbonChain bridges **field-level participation, scientific verification, and blockchain transparency**, transforming restoration into measurable and fraud-proof impact.
