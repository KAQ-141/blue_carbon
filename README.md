# 🌊 **CarbonChain**
**Empowering Communities, Healing Ecosystems**

---

## 💡 Introduction

**Problem Statement:**  
Blue carbon ecosystem restoration in India lacks a decentralized, transparent system for **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)** of projects. Existing methods suffer from data tampering, manual validation delays, and limited participation from NGOs and local panchayats, making carbon credit generation unreliable and non-inclusive.

**Solution:**  
**CarbonChain** is a **Blockchain-powered Blue Carbon Registry and MRV system** that ensures transparency, trust, and accountability in coastal restoration. Through a **Flutter-based mobile DApp**, NGOs and local communities can upload **geo-tagged field data, photos, and project details**, stored immutably on the blockchain.  
AI-assisted validation cross-checks data with **drone/satellite imagery and baseline datasets**, and **NCCR administrators** approve verified projects.  
Smart contracts then **tokenize verified carbon credits** into community digital wallets. A **transparent marketplace** connects corporates and investors to purchase verified offsets while directly supporting local restoration efforts.  

CarbonChain bridges **field-level participation, scientific verification, and blockchain transparency** to make blue carbon restoration measurable, fraud-proof, and impactful.
